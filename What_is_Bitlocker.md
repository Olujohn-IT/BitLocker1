# When/How Bitlock started (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker)

BitLocker originated as a part of Microsoft's Next-Generation Secure Computing Base architecture in 2004.
It was tentatively codenamed *Cornerstone* and was designed to protect information on devices.
Another feature *Code Integrity Rooting* was designed to validate the integrity of Microsoft Windows boot and system files.
BitLocker was briefly called **Secure Startup** before Windows Vista's release to manufacturing.
