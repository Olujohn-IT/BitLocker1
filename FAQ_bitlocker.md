# How does bitlocker protect my data

BitLocker is a built-in encryption feature in Windows that helps protect your data by encrypting your entire drive.

When you access your data, Windows normally has protections associated with your sign-in information.

# What's Bitlocker Recovery Key?

A BitLocker recovery key is a unique 48-digit numerical password that can be used to unlock an encrypted drive.

# Why is Windows asking for recovery key?

Windows requires a BitLocker recovery key when it detects a possible unauthorized attempt to access the data.

This can also happen if you make changes to the hardware, firmware, or software, which BitLocker cannot distinguish from a possible attack.

# How was Bitlocker activated on my device
- Your device automatically enabled Device Encryption
- An administrator on your device manually activated Device Encryption
- An administrator on your device manually activated BitLocker Drive Encryption
- An organization that is managing your device activated BitLocker protection through policy settings
